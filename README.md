# Slime
Game engine on linux console(impleted by python)

##Introduction

Slime now is a basic game structure which runs on linux terminal.It impletes some convenient methods and tools which may fit your bills when developing a game that runs on terminal(like snake).It is developed in python so that the origin code of the structure is opensource.Any suggestions and critises are welcome,and I will try my best to make optimations.
When it come to the principle of the structure, I use some function string which is built in linux(like ESC[2J etc.) to imitate the move of 'pixel'.Of course 'pixel' is not referred to the smallest renderer of screen
